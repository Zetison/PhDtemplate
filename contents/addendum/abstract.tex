A spectral element method (SEM) solver is presented for acoustic scattering. The classical 3D scattering benchmark on a sphere impinged by a plane wave in an unbounded domain is investigated. The unbounded domain is handled by the infinite element method. In this example the geometry (a spherical shell between the scatterer and an artificial boundary) is approximated by 6 patches using Lagrange polynomial interpolation at the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre nodes. The results are compared to spectral properties of isogeometric analysis (IGA) where the conditioning of the system is of particular interest in addition to the geometrical approximation differences. In particular, the exponential behavior of the condition number with respect to the polynomial order is observed for the IGA while an algebraic behavior is observed for the SEM.
