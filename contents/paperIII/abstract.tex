Isogeometric analysis with the boundary element method (IGABEM) has recently gained interest. In this paper, the approximability of IGABEM on 3D acoustic scattering problems will be investigated and a new improved BeTSSi submarine will be presented as a benchmark example. Both Galerkin and collocation are considered in combination with several boundary integral equations (BIE). In addition to the conventional BIE, regularized versions of this BIE will be considered. Moreover, the hyper-singular BIE and the Burton--Miller formulation are also considered. A new adaptive integration routine is presented, and the numerical examples show the importance of the integration procedure in the boundary element method. The numerical examples also include comparison between standard BEM and IGABEM, which again verifies the higher accuracy obtained from the increased inter-element continuity of the spline basis functions. One of the main objectives in this paper is benchmarking acoustic scattering problems, and the method of manufactured solution will be used frequently in this regard.
