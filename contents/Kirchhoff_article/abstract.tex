%Solving scattering problems using numerical steepest descent ... %\cite{Huybrechs2006mah}...
The Kirchhoff approximation yields an accurate approximation of scattering problems on convex rigid bodies for high frequencies. The Kirchhoff--Helmholtz integral has usually been evaluated by discretizing the geometry by triangles, such that the integral may be evaluated exactly. However, this approach has frequency dependent accuracy and frequency dependent memory consumption. In this work, the integrals are evaluated numerically on the exact geometry using the method of numerical steepest descent. Both problems concerning the decreased accuracy and the increased memory consumption for higher frequencies are solved by this approach. The isogeoemtric framework eliminates the tessellation process and enables computations directly on the computer aided design (CAD) model.
