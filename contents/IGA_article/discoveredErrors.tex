\section{List of discovered errors}


\begin{itemize}
	\item In~\cite[pp. 191-192]{Ihlenburg1998fea} Ihlenburg writes that ``... We observe that no resonance peaks are formed at higher eigenmodes for the shells S05 and S15, ...''.
	
	Ihlenburg uses too few samples in the FRF plot to find the resonance peaks at higher eigenmodes.
	
	\item The original article~\cite[p. 4156]{Hughes2005iac} has a misprint in the analytic solution (equation 20). The correct solution is
\begin{equation*}
	u_{\mathrm{r}}(r) = \frac{1}{E}\frac{P R_1^2}{R_0^2 - R_1^2}\left((1-2\nu)(1+\nu)r+\frac{R_0^2(1+\nu)}{r}\right)
\end{equation*}
which can be written as \Cref{Eq2:analyticSolutionSolidCircularCylinder}.

This solution is derived in \Cref{Sec2:solidCircularCylinderSolution}. Where it is also showed that if the solution varies only with $r$ and $\vartheta$, the internal pressure loading $\cos 2\vartheta$ imposes restrictions on the parameter $\nu$. In fact, if we demand that $0\leq \nu\leq 0.5$ then $\nu = 0$ or $\nu = \frac12$.

\item In~\cite[p. 188]{Meirovitch1967ami} there is a misprint in the first eigenfrequency: $C_{01} = 1.015$ where the true value is $C_{01} = 1.0173886$. Hughes copies this misprint in~\cite{Hughes2005iac} such that he compares his result with $\omega_{01} = 53.863$ when the true value is $\omega_{01} = 54.117$. Hence, in~\cite{Cottrell2009iat} there seems to be convergence to the wrong result when this is not the case.

Moreover, the three first eigenmodes in~\cite{Hughes2005iac} does not represent the eigenmodes corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues as the book suggests in Figure 5.20.

\item There is an inconsistency in the length ($L$) of Scordelis-Lo roof in Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13 in~\cite[pp. 125-126]{Cottrell2009iat}. Moreover, the scaling factor should rather be 20 than 200 in 4.13 in~\cite[p. 126]{Cottrell2009iat}.

\item Mulig også en feil i convergensplottet til Hughes~\cite[p. 129]{Cottrell2009iat} for $p=4$, da jeg oppnår bedre resultater her. Har opplevd tilsvarende fenomener når et sett med gausspunkt har en marginal feil.
