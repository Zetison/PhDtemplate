\section{Conclusions}
\label{Sec1:conclusions}
An exact solution to 3D scattering problems on spherical symmetric scatterers has been presented. From a computational point of view, the solution is exact in the sense that round-off errors are the only source of errors. However, these round-off errors play a crucial role for higher frequencies (and also for very low frequencies) when implementing the solution naively. In any case, the computational complexity of the solution is $\bigoh(\omega)$.

A set of benchmark problems have been presented for future references. Results have been presented for some of these benchmarks in both the far-field (frequency domain) and the time domain (near-field). The exact solution presents a vast set of parameters for large ranges, which makes it a good reference solution, as many numerical phenomena can occur for different combinations of these parameters.
